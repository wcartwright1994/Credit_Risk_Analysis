# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of 6 different machine learning algorithms to determine if they should be used to predict credit risk.

The models included are broken down into the following categories:
  * Oversampling (RandomOverSampler and SMOTE)
  * Undersampling (ClusterCentroids)
  * Combination of Oversampling and Undersampling (SMOTEENN)
  * Bias Reduction (BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier)
